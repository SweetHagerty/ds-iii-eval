# Hagerty — Acquisition Channel Analysis (starter)

This notebook is just here to get you past setup — it loads the three tables and shows a quick peek so you can start thinking about the problem instead of about file paths. **Everything past the peek is yours.** There's no prescribed path, and no need to keep or use these cells as written; rework them however you like.

**Where we're starting:** *which acquisition channels bring in the customers most likely to become paying customers?*
